# visualizing-feature-maps-cifar10
We train and evaluate a CNN model from scratch on the CIFAR10 dataset. Plotting layers, filters and feature maps to use as debugging tools. They help us understand the behaviour of CNNs better. The notebook is implemented in Keras.
The pre-trained weights are included as a google drive link. The notebook is self explanatory.
